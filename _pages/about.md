Hi! I'm Tuan, a junior student at Department of Data Science and Artifical Intelligence, [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn), advised by Professor <a href='https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/'>Linh Ngo.</a>

**Work:** My current research is focused on Computer Vision algorithms at [Viettel High Tech](https://viettelhightech.vn), [Viettel Group](https://viettel.com.vn/en/). These models are being deployed in practical applications at [IWannaTech](https://www.facebook.com/iwannatech), and my primary areas of research and application include real-time Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, and Object Detection.

**Research:** At [DSLab](https://bkai.ai/research/machine-learning/), I am exploring new models and methods for Continual Learning, which enables machines to learn continuously from tasks to tasks, even when data is received sequentially and infinitely. My current work is focused on adaptive dropout neural networks within this architecture.

**Community:** I'm core-team member of two Google community organizations, including [Google Developer Groups Hanoi](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ha-noi/) and [Google Developer Students Club - Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://gdsc.community.dev/hanoi-university-of-science-technology-hust/). A strong enthusiasm exists within me for disseminating knowledge and arranging events within the research and developer community. Through these organizations, I have successfully organized several events, such as Google I/O 2022, AI Day VinAI 2022, Google DevFest Hanoi 2022, and International Women's Day x Flutter Forward Extended Hanoi 2023. The opportunity to speak at Google DevFest22 was an honor for me, where the topic of my presentation was ["Detecting Cheating in Examinations".](https://www.facebook.com/GDGhanoi/photos/a.295913770557546/2473122272836674/)

**Blog:** In my personal time, I enjoy writing and maintain a blog called [Humans of HUST](https://www.facebook.com/pageofhumanshust). The blog primarily focuses on topics related to life, academics, and relationships.
