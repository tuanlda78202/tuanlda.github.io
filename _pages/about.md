Hi! I'm Tuan, a junior student at [Department of Data Science and Artifical Intelligence](https://stat.utexas.edu/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn), advised by Professor <a href='https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/'>Linh Ngo</a>

**Research:** My current works on Continual Learning topic, investigating at [DSLab](https://bkai.ai/research/machine-learning/)

**Experience** I'm engaged in Computer Vision at @ViettelHighTech and @IWannaTech. I possess a passion for organizing events tailored to the developer and researcher community and has successfully executed notable events such as Google I/O, DevFest, and VinAI Day.
