Hi! I'm Tuan ðŸ¤— a junior DS-AI student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

**Research:** 
* My current research is focused on INRs for videos at Viettel, specifically addressing video reconstruction, compression, and in-painting tasks. 
* My work led to the development of NeRV3D, a SOTA paper that outperformed all existing research in the field.

**Community:** 
* Dual role as Technical Team Lead at [GDG Hanoi](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-ha-noi/) and Head of Events & PR at [GDSC HUST](https://gdsc.community.dev/hanoi-university-of-science-technology-hust/). 

* A strong enthusiasm exists within me for disseminating knowledge and arranging events within the research and developer community. Thanks to these efforts, I have successfully coordinated several prominent events, including Google I/O 2022, AI Day 2022, DevFest Hanoi 2022, and IWD x Flutter Forward Extended Hanoi 2023.
  
* The opportunity to speak at Google DevFest22 was an honor for me, where the topic of my presentation was ["Detecting Cheating in Examinations".](https://www.facebook.com/GDGhanoi/photos/a.295913770557546/2473122272836674/)

**Blog:** In my leisure time, I find pleasure in writing and curating content for my blog, "Humans of HUST." This blog is dedicated to exploring various aspects of life, academia, and love. You can find it at [Humans of HUST](https://www.facebook.com/pageofhumanshust).
