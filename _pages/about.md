Hi! I'm Tuan, a junior student at [Department of Data Science and Artifical Intelligence](https://stat.utexas.edu/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn), advised by Professor [Linh Ngo](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).

**Research:** My current works on [Continual Learning] topic, investigating at [DSLab](https://bkai.ai/research/machine-learning/)


Organizing events for the developer/researcher community is my passion, as I have run events like Google I/O, DevFest, VinAI Day,... Currently, he's in charge of two teams: Technical (@GDGHN) and Event-PR (@GDSC-HUST).
Not only that, he also has a hobby of writing and has his own Humans of HUST blog.
