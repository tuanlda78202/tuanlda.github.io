Hi! I'm Charles ðŸ¤— Senior DS-AI student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

**Research:** 
* Presently, I'm engaged in my graduation thesis, centering on applying class-specific prompts and VLM for task identification, while also integrating cross- and distill attention into the DETR decoder to facilitate class-incremental learning in object detection.
  
* My past work includes developing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for video tasks - reconstruction, compression, and in-painting - and medical image segmentation for MRI, specifically for rectal cancer diagnosis and treatment. Another research focuses on leveraging Conditional Diffusion Model to achieve ultra-low bitrate compression while maintaining optimal realism.
  * A key achievement is my state-of-the-art paper, 3DNeRV, which enhances video reconstruction and compression, now advancing to phase 2 in AAAI 2024. (ðŸŽ‰ Update: 28/09/2023)

**Community:** 

* Passionate commitment to sharing knowledge and organizing events in the research and developer community is evident. This dedication has resulted in the successful coordination of several key events, such as Google I/O Extended Hanoi 2022, AI Day 2022, DevFest Hanoi 2022, IWD x FFE Hanoi 2023, Google I/O Extended Hanoi 2023, Google DevFest Hanoi 2023 and Google Build with AI 2024. Recently, there was also involvement as an AI mentor for the SheCodes Hackathon Hanoi 2023.
  
* The opportunity to speak at Google DevFest 2022 was an honor for me, where the topic of my presentation was ["Detecting Cheating in Examinations"](https://www.facebook.com/GDGhanoi/photos/a.295913770557546/2473122272836674/).
  * DCE entails researching and deploying a real-time cheating detection solution for 100-person exam rooms; featured on [VTV24](https://www.facebook.com/tintucvtv24/videos/772744667380774), [HUST](https://hust.edu.vn/vi/news/tin-tuc-su-kien/phan-mem-chong-gian-lan-thi-cu-duoc-nhom-sinh-vien-thu-nghiem-thanh-cong-648900.html), [DanTri](https://dantri.com.vn/giao-duc/phan-mem-chong-gian-lan-thi-cu-duoc-nhom-sinh-vien-thu-nghiem-thanh-cong-20220906211003512.htm),...

**Blog:** 

* In my free time, I enjoy writing for my blog, ["Humans of HUST"](https://www.facebook.com/pageofhumanshust), where share insights and stories about my life, encompassing academics, research, and personal reflections.
