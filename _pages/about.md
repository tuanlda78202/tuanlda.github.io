Hi! I'm Tuan ðŸ¤— Senior DS-AI student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

**Research:** 
* My current topic is focused on INRs for videos, specifically addressing video reconstruction, compression, and in-painting tasks. 
* My work resulted in 3DNeRV, a SOTA paper that surpassed existing research in the field, submitted to AAAI 2024, advancing video reconstruction and compression.

**Community:** 

* A strong enthusiasm exists within me for disseminating knowledge and organizing events within the research and developer community. Thanks to these endeavors, I have successfully coordinated several notable events, including Google I/O Extended Hanoi 2022, AI Day 2022, DevFest Hanoi 2022, IWD x FFE Hanoi 2023, Google I/O Extended Hanoi 2023, and I have recently become an AI mentor for the SheCodes Hackathon Hanoi 2023. 
  
* The opportunity to speak at Google DevFest22 was an honor for me, where the topic of my presentation was ["Detecting Cheating in Examinations".](https://www.facebook.com/GDGhanoi/photos/a.295913770557546/2473122272836674/)

**Blog:** In my leisure time, I find pleasure in writing and curating content for my blog, ["Humans of HUST".](https://www.facebook.com/pageofhumanshust)

* This blog serves as an outlet for me to express my thoughts and share daily stories encompassing various aspects of my life, including studies, research working and matters of the heart.
